  <b> CHAT BOT </b>
 1. This bot responds automatically to donars with all frequently asked questions. 
 2. It will exist in the donar login page taking care of not leveraging the data to outside users other than donars.
 
 <b> ADMIN PAGE </b>
 1. The admin website has four different features. 
  - Check in a patient
  - Check out a patient
  - View patient details.
 We have used firebase as main database for patients', centres',admins' details storage. This gives high flexibility for the maintenace people too to easily post or get data.
